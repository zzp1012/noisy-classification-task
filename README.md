# noisy-classification-task

## Abstract

**Overall Objective**: : train statistical learning models with data we provided, and achieve as high test accuracy as you can.

## Requirements

In this project, you should:
- try at least three different statistical learning methods, and at least two of them are NOT deep learning. We recommand methods learnt in this course.
- use at least two model assessment and selection methods to choose the best model and enhance the robustness and generalization ability of your models.
- submit a report, your codes, and the results on test dataset following the instructions in section 3.

## Preparation

1. Clone the project
    ```bash
        git clone --recurse-submodules -j8 git@github.com:zzp1012/noisy-classification-task.git
    ```

1. Simply create an virtural environment. If you use `anaconda3` or `miniconda`, you can run following instructions to download the required packages in python. 
    ```bash
         conda env create --file environment.yaml
    ```

## Contributing
